Added a "wrong" implementation of Exoplayer with QT and QML

TODO:
- move Exoplayer calls to correct thread
- refactor project
- correct vertex and fragment shader to mantain aspect ratio
- implement chooser for SurfaveView or TextureView video output, currently only a basic TextureView implemented
- a lot of things...
